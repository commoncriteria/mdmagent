  <chapter id="int" title="Introduction">
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview"> This Extended Package (EP) describes security
      requirements for a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Agent and is intended to provide a minimal
      baseline set of requirements that are targeted at mitigating well defined and described
      threats. The Agent of an MDM system is only one component of an enterprise deployment of
      mobile devices. Other components, such as the mobile device platforms which enforce the
      security policies, and servers which host mobile application repositories, are out of scope.
      This introduction describes the features of a compliant Target of Evaluation (TOE) and
      discusses how this EP is to be used in conjunction with the MDM Protection Profile (PP) or the
      Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) PP. </section>

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">The MDM system consists of
      two primary components: the MDM Server software and the MDM Agent.<br/> The MDM operational
      environment consists of the mobile device on which the MDM Agent resides, the platform on
      which the MDM Server runs, and an untrusted wireless network over which they communicate, as
      pictured below. <figure entity="images/MDMagentoperatingenvironment.jpg"
        title="Figure 1: MDM System Operating Environment" id="agentoperatingenvironment"/> The MDM
      Agent, which is the focus of this EP, is installed on a mobile device as an application or is
      part of the mobile device’s OS. The MDM Agent establishes a secure connection back to the MDM
      Server controlled by an enterprise administrator. Optionally, the MDM Agent interacts with the
      Mobile Application Store (MAS) Server to download and install enterprise-hosted
      application.<br/> The MDM Agent must closely interact with or be part of (as depicted by the
      dotted red/blue line in Figure 1) the mobile device’s platform to establish policies and
      perform queries about device status. The mobile device, in turn, has its own security
      requirements specified in the MDF PP against which the mobile device must be evaluated either
      concurrently with or before the MDM Agent evaluation.<br/> If the MDM Agent is part of the
      mobile device’s OS, the agent may present multiple interfaces for configuring the mobile
      device, such as a local interface and a remote interface. Agents conforming to this profile
      must at least offer an interface with a trusted channel that serves as one piece of an MDM
      system. Compliant agents may also offer other interfaces, and the configuration aspects of
      these additional interfaces is in scope of this EP. </section>

      <cclaim id="Conformance Statement">
        <description> This EP extends the MDM PP v2.x when the MDM Agent is installed on a mobile
          device as an application that is developed by the MDM developer. This EP extends the MDF
          PP when the MDM Agent is built into the mobile device platform by the mobile device
          vendor.<br/> As an EP of either the MDM PP v2.x or the MDF PP v2.x, it is expected that
          the content of this EP and the chosen PP be appropriately combined in the context of each
          product-specific Security Target. This EP has been specifically defined such that there
          should be no difficulty or ambiguity in doing so. When this EP is used with the MDM PP
          v2.x or the MDF PP v2.x, conformant TOEs are obligated to implement the functionality
          required in those PPs with the additional functionality defined in this EP in response to
          the threat environment discussed subsequently herein. An ST must identify the applicable
          versions of the PP chosen and this EP in its conformance claims. <br/> This EP serves to
          complement the MDM PP v2.x or the MDF PP v2.x with additional SFRs and associated
          Assurance Activities specific to the MDM Agent. Assurance Activities are the actions that
          the evaluator performs in order to determine a TOE’s compliance to the SFRs. <br/> This EP
          conforms to Common Criteria <cite linkend="bibCC"/> for Information Technology Security
          Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 4. It is CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant. In
          order to be conformant to this EP, the ST must include all components in this EP and the
          associated PP that are: <ul><li>unconditional (which are always required)</li>
            <li>selection-based (which are required when certain selections are chosen in the
              unconditional requirements)</li></ul> and may include optional and/or objective
          components that are desirable but not required for conformance. </description>

  <chapter id="spd" title="Security Problem Description">MDM Agents address a range of security
    threats from theft of sensitive data to unauthorized access to malicious application downloads.
    While many of these threats also apply to the MDM Server and the mobile device itself, the MDM
    Agent plays a key role in ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data is maintained by
    interfacing directly with the OS of the device, either through a 3rd party application or as a
    part of the mobile device OS itself. Applicable threats addressed by the MDM Agent include
    malicious and flawed applications, network attacks, network eavesdropping, and physical
    access.<br/> Appendix A presents the Security Problem Description (SPD) in a more “traditional”
    form. The following sections detail the problems that compliant TOEs will address; references to
    the “traditional” statements in Appendix A are included. 
    <section id="threats" title="Threats">
     <threats>
      <threat id="T.MALICIOUS_APPS">
        <description>Malicious or flawed application (app) threats exist because apps loaded onto a
          Mobile Device may include malicious or exploitable code. This code could be included
          unwittingly by its developer, perhaps as part of a software library. Malicious apps may
          attempt to exfiltrate data to which they have access. Malicious apps may be able to
          control the device's sensors (geolocation, camera, microphone, etc.) to gather
          intelligence about the user's surroundings even when those activities do not involve data
          resident or transmitted from the device. Flawed apps may give an attacker access to
          perform network-based or physical attacks that otherwise would have been prevented.
        </description>
      </threat>
      <threat id="T.NETWORK_ATTACK">
        <description>An attacker may position themselves on a wireless communications channel or
          elsewhere on the network infrastructure. From this vantage point, an attacker may initiate
          communication with the mobile device or alter communication between elements of the
          operating environment and other endpoints. By altering this communication, the attacker
          may be able to spoof the MDM Server. </description>
      </threat>
      <threat id="T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP">
        <description>In a similar manner to the network attack threat, an attacker may position
          themselves on a wireless communications channel or elsewhere on the network
          infrastructure. The attacker may then monitor or gain access to data being sent or
          received by the MDM Agent. By monitoring this data, the attacker may intercept security
          critical data including cryptographic keys and human-user authentication data.
        </description>
      </threat>
      <threat id="T.PHYSICAL_ACCESS">
        <description>Loss or theft of the underlying mobile device platform may give rise to loss of
          confidentiality of user data, including, most importantly, credentials. Physical access
          attacks involve attempts to access the device through external hardware ports, through its
          user interface, or through direct and possible destructive access to its storage media.
          Such attacks are intended to gain access to data from a lost or stolen mobile device that
          it is not expected to be returned to its owner. Although these attacks are primarily
          directed against the mobile device platform, the MDM Agent configures features which
          address this threat. </description>

              device is required to perform the mandated cryptographic protocols as in the base PP
              for communication channels mandated in the MDF PP. The ST author must select one of
              TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS in order to establish and maintain a trusted channel between the
              TOE and the MDM Server. Only TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS are used in this trusted

              mobile device information data (software version, hardware model, and application
              versions), and configuration data collected by the MDM Agent and sent from the MDM
              Agent to the MDM Server, when commanded, or at configurable intervals, is properly
              protected. This trusted channel also protects any commands and policies sent by the
              MDM Server to the MDM Agent. Either the MDM Agent or the MDM Server is able to
              initiate the connection.<br/> This trusted channel protects both the connection
              between an enrolled MDM Agent and the MDM Server and the connection between an
              unenrolled MDM Agent and the MDM Server during the enrollment operation. Different
              protocols can be used for these two connections, and the description in the TSS should
              make this difference clear.<br/> The trusted channel uses TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS as the
              protocol that preserves the confidentiality and integrity of MDM communications. The
              ST author chooses the mechanism or mechanisms supported by the TOE, and then ensures

              users who connect to multiple enterprises.<br/> Policies must be digitally signed by
              the enterprise using the algorithms in FCS_COP.1(3).</note>
            <aactivity>
              <h4>TSS</h4>The evaluator also ensures that the TSS (or the operational guidance)
              describes how the candidate policies are obtained by the MDM Agent; the processing
              associated with verifying the digital signature of the policy updates; and the actions
              that take place for successful (signature was verified) and unsuccessful (signature
              could not be verified) cases. The software components that are performing the
              processing must also be identified in the TSS and verified by the evaluators.
              <h4>Tests</h4>The evaluator shall perform a policy update from an available
              configuration interface (such as through a test MDM Server). The evaluator shall
              verify the update is signed and is provided to the MDM Agent. The evaluator shall
              verify the MDM Agent accepts the digitally signed policy. The evaluator shall perform
              a policy update from an available configuration interface (such as through a test MDM
              Server). The evaluator shall provide an unsigned and an incorrectly signed policy to
              the MDM Agent. The evaluator shall verify the MDM Agent does not accept the digitally
              signed policy. </aactivity>

  <section title="Security Assurance Requirements" id="SARs"> It is important to note that a TOE that
    is evaluated against this EP is inherently evaluated against the MDF PP or the MDM PP as well.
    Those PPs include a number of Assurance Activities associated with both Security Functional
    Requirements (SFRs) and SARs. Additionally, this EP includes a number of SFR-based Assurance
    Activities that similarly refine the SARs identified in the base PPs. The assurance activities
    associated with SARs that are prescribed by the MDF PP or MDM PP are performed against the
    entire TOE.

  <appendix title="Optional Requirements" id="optional"> The baseline requirements (those that must
    be performed by the mdm agent are contained in the main body of this EP. Additionally, there are
    three other types of requirements specified in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref
      linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref linkend="objective"/>. The first type (in this Appendix)
    are requirements that can be included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, but are not required in order
    for an mdm agent to claim conformance to this PP. The second type (in <appref
      linkend="sel-based"/>) are requirements based on selections in the body of the EP: if certain
    selections are made, then additional requirements in that appendix must be included. The third
    type (in <appref linkend="objective"/> are components that are not required in order to conform
    to this EP, but will be included in the baseline requirements in future versions of this EP, so
    adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the ST author is responsible for ensuring that
    requirements that may be associated with those in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref
      linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref linkend="objective"/> but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type
    requirements) are also included in the ST.</appendix>
  <appendix title="Selection-Based Requirements" id="sel-based">As indicated in the introduction to
    this EP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the mdm agent or its
    underlying platform) are contained in the body of this EP. There are additional requirements
    based on selections from the MDM or MDF PP and/or in the body of the EP: if certain selections
    are made, then additional requirements below will need to be included.</appendix>
  <appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This Annex includes requirements that
    specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently
    mandated in the body of this EP as they describe security functionality not yet widely-available
    in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the
    mdm agent is still conformant to this EP, and it is expected that they be included as soon as
    possible.</appendix>

  <appendix id="entropyappendix" title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment"> This appendix describes the
    required supplementary information for each entropy source used by the TOE.<br/> The
    documentation of the entropy source(s) should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS. <section id="design" name="Design Description">
      Documentation shall include the design of each entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product.<br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are
      encouraged.<br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security
      boundary of the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an
      adversary outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.<br/> If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="justification" name="Entropy Justification"> There should be a technical argument
      for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence in the
      entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by this
      particular TOE). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy rate
      (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the TOE randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy.<br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
      depends on the type of entropy source included in the product.<br/> For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output.<br/> For third party provided entropy sources, in which the TOE
      vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the documentation
      will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this third-party source.
      It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy, however, this assumption
      must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular, the min-entropy estimate
      must be specified and the assumption included in the ST.<br/> Regardless of type of entropy
      source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is initialized with the entropy
      stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy rate is multiplied by the
      amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of entropy expected based on the
      amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the statistical rate. If the amount
      of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the calculated rate is not explicitly
      related to the seed, the documentation will not be considered complete.<br/> The entropy
      justification shall not include any data added from any third-party application or from any
      state saving between restarts. </section>
    <section id="conditions" name="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be affected by
      conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage, frequency,
      temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may affect the
      operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range of
      operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data.
      Similarly, documentation shall describe the conditions under which the entropy source is no
      longer guaranteed to provide sufficient entropy. Methods used to detect failure or degradation
      of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="health" name="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source health tests
      and their rationale will be documented. This will include a description of the health tests,
      the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at startup,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, TOE behavior upon
      entropy source failure, and rationale indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate
      for detecting one or more failures in the entropy source. </section>
