    <section id="overview" title="Overview">
      This <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> describes security requirements for a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Agent and is intended to provide a minimal baseline set of requirements that are targeted at mitigating well defined and described threats. The Agent of an MDM system is only one component of an enterprise deployment of mobile devices. <!-- TODO: Need to update the next sentence, b/c original it was written just with MDM Server, so MDF and MAS were out of scope -->Other components, such as the mobile device platforms, which enforce the security policies, and servers, which host mobile application repositories, are out of scope. This introduction describes the features of a compliant Target of Evaluation (TOE) and discusses how this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> is to be used in conjunction with the MDM Protection Profile (PP) or the Mobile Device Fundamentals (MDF) <abbr linkend="PP"/>.

      The MDM system consists of two primary components: the MDM Server software and the MDM Agent. <htm:br/><htm:br/> 
      The MDM operational environment consists of the mobile device on which the MDM Agent resides, the platform on which the MDM Server runs, and an untrusted wireless network over which they communicate.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
      The MDM Agent, which is the focus of this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/>, is installed on a mobile device as an application (supplied by the developer of the MDM Server software) or is part of the mobile device’s OS. The MDM Agent establishes a secure connection back to the MDM Server, which is controlled by an enterprise administrator. Optionally, the MDM Agent interacts with the Mobile Application Store (MAS) Server to download and install enterprise-hosted applications.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
      If the MDM Agent is part of the mobile device’s OS, the MDM Agent may present multiple interfaces for configuring the mobile device, such as a local interface and a remote interface. Agents conforming to this Extended Package must at least offer an interface with a trusted channel that serves as one piece of an MDM system. Conformant MDM Agents may also offer other interfaces, and the configuration aspects of these additional interfaces are in scope of this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/>.<htm:br/><htm:br/>           
        Figure 1 shows a high-level example of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> boundary and its operational environment. As stated above, note that the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> resides on the MDM Agent and may either be provided as part of the mobile device itself (shown in red) or distributed as a third-party application from the developer of the MDM Server software (shown in blue).<htm:br/><htm:br/>    
        <figure entity="images/mdm-system-operating-environment.png" title="MDM System Operating Environment" id="toe"/><htm:br/>
        The MDM Agent must closely interact with or be part of the mobile device’s platform in order to establish policies and to perform queries about device status. The mobile device, in turn, has its own security requirements specified in the MDF <abbr linkend="PP"/>. The mobile device must be evaluated against the MDF <abbr linkend="PP"/>, either concurrently with the MDM Agent or prior to the evaluation of the MDM Agent. This is true regardless of whether the MDM Agent is a native part of the mobile device OS or a third-party application.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
      
      <!-- TODO: Update versions of bases and have to specify the exact version -->
      This <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> can extend the Mobile Device Fundamentals <abbr linkend="PP"/> v3.x or the Mobile Device Management Server <abbr linkend="PP"/> v3.x:<htm:br/><htm:br/> 
      <htm:b>Extends Mobile Device</htm:b><htm:br/><htm:br/>
      The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is a native part of a mobile operating system. The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> for this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> combined with the MDF <abbr linkend="PP"/> is the mobile device itself plus the MDM Agent.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
      <htm:b>Extends MDM Server</htm:b><htm:br/><htm:br/>
      The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is a third-party application that is provided with an MDM Server and installed on a mobile device by the user after acquiring the mobile device. The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> for this <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> combined with the MDM Server <abbr linkend="PP"/> is the entire MDM environment, which includes both the MDM Server and the MDM Agent. Even though the mobile device itself is not part of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, it is expected to be evaluated against the MDF <abbr linkend="PP"/> so that its baseline security capabilities can be assumed to be present.

    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecase">
      This <abbr linkend="PP-Module"/> defines 4 use cases:<htm:br/><htm:br/>
          <usecases>
            <usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose enterprise use" id="usecase1">
              <description>
                An Enterprise-owned device for general-purpose business use is commonly called Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE). This use case entails a significant degree of Enterprise control over configuration and software inventory. Enterprise administrators use an MDM product to establish policies on the mobile devices prior to user issuance. Users may use Internet connectivity to browse the web or access corporate mail or run Enterprise applications, but this connectivity may be under significant control of the Enterprise. The user may also be expected to store data and use applications for personal, non-enterprise use. The Enterprise administrator uses the MDM product to deploy security policies and query mobile device status. The MDM may issue commands for remediation actions.
              </description>
            </usecase>
            <usecase title="Enterprise-owned device for specialized, high-security use" id="usecase2">
              <description>An Enterprise-owned device with intentionally limited network connectivity, tightly controlled configuration, and limited software inventory is appropriate for specialized, high-security use cases. As in the previous use case, the MDM product is used to establish such policies on mobile devices prior to issuance to users. The device may not be permitted connectivity to any external peripherals. It may only be able to communicate via its Wi-Fi or cellular radios with the Enterprise-run network, which may not even permit connectivity to the Internet. Use of the device may require compliance with usage policies that are more restrictive than those in any general-purpose use case, yet may mitigate risks to highly sensitive information. Based upon the operation environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 <!-- TODO: Update reference -->of this Protection Profile along with the selections in the <!-- TODO: Will need to update this reference to use case templats -->Use Case 2 template defined in Section G.2 are sufficient for the high-security use case.
              </description>
            </usecase>
            <usecase title="Personally owned device for personal and enterprise use" id="usecase3">
              <description>A personally owned device, which is used, for both personal activities and enterprise data is commonly called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). The device may be provisioned for access to enterprise resources after significant personal usage has occurred. Unlike in the enterprise-owned cases, the enterprise is limited in what security policies it can enforce because the user purchased the device primarily for personal use and is unlikely to accept policies that limit the functionality of the device.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                However, because the Enterprise allows the user full (or nearly full) access to the Enterprise network, the Enterprise will require certain security policies, for example a password or screen lock policy, and health reporting, such as the integrity of the mobile device system software, before allowing access. The administrator of the MDM can establish remediation actions, such as wipe of the Enterprise data, for non-compliant devices. These controls could potentially be enforced by a separation mechanism built-in to the device itself to distinguish between enterprise and personal activities, or by a third-party application that provides access to enterprise resources and leverages security capabilities provided by the mobile device. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this Protection Profile along with the selections in the Use Case 3 template defined in Section G.3 are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.</description>
            </usecase>
            <usecase title="Personally owned device for personal and limited enterprise use" id="usecase4">
              <description>A personally owned device may also be given access to limited enterprise services such as enterprise email. Because the user does not have full access to the enterprise or enterprise data, the enterprise may not need to enforce any security policies on the device. However, the enterprise may want secure email and web browsing with assurance that the services being provided to those clients by the Mobile Device are not compromised. Based upon the operational environment and the acceptable risk level of the enterprise, those security functional requirements outlined in Section 5 of this <abbr linkend="PP"/> are sufficient for the secure implementation of this BYOD use case.</description>

<!-- The Following was appendix E in Agent EP that defined the selections needed, not sure where to put it in the module -->
        <!--  The following use case templates list those selections, assignments, and objective requirements that best support the use cases identified by this Protection Profile. Note that the templates assume that all <abbr linkend="SFR"/>s listed in Section 5 are included in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, not just those listed in the templates. These templates and deviations from the template should be identified in the Security Target to assist customers with making risk-based purchasing decisions. Products that do not meet these templates are not precluded from use in the scenarios identified by this Protection Profile.<htm:br/><htm:br/>

              An attacker may try to target backups of data or credentials and exfiltrate data. Since the backup is stored on either a personal computer or end user’s backup repository, it’s not likely enterprise would detect compromise.

              <note role="application">
                This requirement is inherited from the base <abbr linkend="PP"/>; the mobile device is required to perform the mandated cryptographic protocols as in the base <abbr linkend="PP"/> for communication channels mandated in the MDF <abbr linkend="PP"/>. The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author must select one of TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS in order to establish and maintain a trusted channel between the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> and the MDM Server. Only TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS are used in this trusted channel.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                This requirement is to ensure that the transmission of any audit logs, mobile device information data (software version, hardware model, and application versions), and configuration data collected by the MDM Agent and sent from the MDM Agent to the MDM Server, when commanded, or at configurable intervals, is properly protected. This trusted channel also protects any commands and policies sent by the MDM Server to the MDM Agent. Either the MDM Agent or the MDM Server is able to initiate the connection.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                This trusted channel protects both the connection between an enrolled MDM Agent and the MDM Server and the connection between an unenrolled MDM Agent and the MDM Server during the enrollment operation. Different protocols can be used for these two connections, and the description in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> should make this difference clear.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                The trusted channel uses TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS as the protocol that preserves the confidentiality and integrity of MDM communications. The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author chooses the mechanism or mechanisms supported by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>, and then ensures the detailed requirements in Appendix C corresponding to their selection are copied to the <abbr linkend="ST"/> if not already present.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                Protocol, RBG, Certificate validation, algorithm, and similar services may be met with platform provided services. <htm:br/><htm:br/>

  <appendix id="entropy" title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment">
    The <abbr linkend="TOE"/> does not require any additional supplementary information to describe its entropy source(s) beyond the requirements outlined in the ‘Entropy Documentation and Assessment’ sections of the MDF and MDM <abbr linkend="PP"/>s. As with other base <abbr linkend="PP"/> requirements, the only additional requirement is that the entropy documentation also applies to the specific MDM Agent capabilities of the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> in addition to the functionality required by the base <abbr linkend="PP"/>.
